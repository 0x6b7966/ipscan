Feedback
========

Please use Github's [issues](https://github.com/angryip/ipscan/issues)
and [pull-requests](https://github.com/angryip/ipscan/pulls).

Previously, there was a bug tracker provided by [Sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ipscan),
but it is not in active use anymore.

Helping
-------

As currently Angry IP Scanner is mostly a one-man project, any help is greatly appreciated.

You can help with:

* Testing on different platforms
* Submitting bug reports / feature requests
* Monitoring submitted bug reports / feature requests
* Editing [FAQ](/faq/) page, adding various _tips & tricks_
* Writing additional [Feeders, Fetchers or Exporters](/contribute/plugins.html)
* Sending pull-requests
