Angry IP Scanner, the original IP scanner, continues to be a popular network tool for scanning of IP addresses in local networks as well as in open Internet.

* [Sourceforge.net downloads](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ipscan/files/stats/timeline?dates=2001-03-01+to+2016-03-01) page 
  reports **13 million** downloads since Angry IP Scanner was released there.
* Newer download links are hosted on [GitHub](https://angryip.org/download/stats.html) since 2014, and it reports more than **5 million** download as of now.

Please note, these are only statistics from the "official" download sites. There are plenty of other mirrors and CD/DVD compilations, 
which I cannot track, so the actual number of downloads can be several times bigger.
